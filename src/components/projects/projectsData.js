          the analysis for you and LP gives you future proof prediction using your previous tasks. No spying, every 
          is automated. We call this the MAP(Manage, Analyse & Predict) activity. <br /><br />
          The analyse task is still in testing and enhancement phase and doesn't give best results at the moment, but works(important). 
          The Prediction feature is still in development. We working to use the most effective algorithms, AI tools and machine learning to 
          train the algorithms to give accurate prediction model.<br /><br />
          At LP, we do believe, manage your tasks should be automated and effective.</p>`,

    users to select their transportation of choice. There is more flexibility to both users and drivers with customizable features. Currently, this solution is used in the US and there's need 
    to expand to other countinents as well.<br /><br />
    I, Nicanor, was part of a team whom I led to create this product from inception to completion. I designed the User interfaces using Figma and adobe illustrator. With rapid implementation on development
    the project came to life after two months.</p>`,
